# Day 5 - Docker

## Why use docker? Different from containers?

According to the official docker [website](https://www.docker.com/)

> Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud. Dockerâ€™s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

> I am not sure if the docker gui is needed but it does give a nice overview of what's going on.

The best way to be introducted to docker and its functionalities, internals, and power is to refer to the official docker documentation and use the docker image provided by:

> docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
