# Spotify NFTs
The idea is very simple. Have a spotify like service including ads etc.
Make the service a subscription people can buy into or can have an advert listening experience.
Allow artists to create and share music.
All music will be an NFT that people can own.
Allow trading of the music and generation of passive income from people who listen to the music itself.

### Explanation
In spotify, money is given to the music based on number of plays and other metrics.
Similarly, the number of plays and other metrics will be tracked and money will be given for such actions by the user.
Now, % of the money given is given to the owner of the NFT and % to the artist that created the music.
This way owners can generate passive income.

> Also on NFT transfers a % (like OpenSea) of the NFT trade cost will be given to the artist.
> So the artist will have incentive not only to make music but to make good music that people want to play.
>
> Owners will have incentive to retain NFTs as it generates passive income for them.
>
> Listeners will have incentive as they can access all the music they want to listen to.

### Backend
Music storage may need to be centralized and gated so as to not allow free distribution in order to get and maintain subscribers.

### Reality Check
It seems like a cool idea that is likely to fail.
