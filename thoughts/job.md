# Job
> Job needs DSA, System Design, Operating Systems, Computer Networks. I will need to learn all these things to be eligible for succeeding in internviews and getting hired.

Currently, my plans are for a MS for which I am awaiting results from the universities I applied to, I was originally planning to do 'job' prep during the period from Jan to Mar but I had somehow continued to take on more research tasks and looked for more research based opportunities even when they are not going to be relevant anytime before the end of this year. I have no clue nor plans but a wish for wealth. I have no clue what will happen. The odds are very very low. Its highly likely that the unis won't have a positive response for my attempts and I will unfortunately be left in the rain again. Starting at an abyss with no clue on what is going to happen. With no prospects and no way out, forced into something far below what I am capable of.

Fuck you COVID. You took away 2 years of work and then troubled me with 2 years of failed prospects. Nothing has worked out for me due to one reason or another. Assholes tell me to not blame my failures but wtf am I suppoed to do about the world burning to ashes. I was setting out to explore being struck by a never ending storm. Online DOESNT WORK. Startups CANNOT be built online. Networking CANNOT be done online. Human learning CANNOT be done online. At least at this current time.
