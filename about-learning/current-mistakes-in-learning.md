# My common pitfalls
> There are common pitfalls unique to me. Here is a documentation on them and how to avoid it:

### Trying to be Over-organized
> A new zeal to learn often leaves a want to organize content that has not yet been writen into directory structures that cannot be predicted. This is a waste of time and energy as it takes away from the learning and overinvests to the process of organizing the learning. Attempts should be made at the end not the beginning.

### Trying to speedup learning
> In an attempt to cover for lost time and insecurities with my technical skills I have lost time to overspeeding courses. This way I listen to a lot but learn little. It has not served me over the long-term, which should be the ideal goal.

### Trying to jot down more than I can code in my head
> I scribe every little detail and aspect. In the age of information, I only need to scribe bullet points and learn enough to fill the gaps.
>
> It is true that a basket that holds fruit cannot hold water but a pot that holds water is wasted on holding fruit. Effort and time devoted should be proportional to the time needed. Perfection is needed within not without.
